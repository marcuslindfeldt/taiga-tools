// Mixins
//
// Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the
// many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS
// declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass
// in values to make your mixin more flexible.
//
// NOTE: Module specific mixins should be defined in the module.
